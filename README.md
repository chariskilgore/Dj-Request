# Dj-Request
-This app should be used with an NFC device that will trigger a prompt box that asks the user to populate two input boxes. One will have the song name and the other will have the artist name. 
-There will be room on the prompt to have a background of choosing. And styled to the brand. 
-The prompt box will also have a tip button that will put the tip into the Djs bank. The tip can be added when they submit the form. 
-The request will be sent to the DJ as a text message to any number they choose. 
-The Dj's playlist will alert the user that the song has been played and ask if they would like to leave a tip. (There will be pre set dollar amounts or be left to freely fill to any amount. I might have a small fee or minimum to tip if there is a transaction fee.)
-This could be linked to their spotify account.
-After the user has made their request the box will close and they are left looking at the Dj's website or page. It will be a simple discography or scheduled dates and a BOOKNow button that will use an app like calendly or something of the like. 
-This is not a social. The user should not have to download the app to request. The NFC should take the mobile user to the page directly. The only things they should fill out is the two input and press a button for a tip. Easy.
-Goal is to hook up Cashapp to the tip or any bank routing number. Prepaid visas as well as established insured banks. It would be nice to be able to offer a prepaid visa to their dj account.
